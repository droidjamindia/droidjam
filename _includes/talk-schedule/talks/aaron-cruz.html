			<p>The story for the future of parallelism in Ruby is looking pretty bleak. Matz just said at Euruko that it will be a while (years) before the notorious Global Interpreter Lock is gone.</p>
<p>So I've been on a journey to find a more modern replacement that gives me the same joy that I feel when I write Ruby. It turns out that with modern programming languages, it's actually not that hard to learn a new technology.</p>
<p>I've found some great candidates in Go, Elixir and a newcomer Crystal. I'll dig in and show you some code and you can decide if maybe, you too, want to enter Parallel World with me!</p>
