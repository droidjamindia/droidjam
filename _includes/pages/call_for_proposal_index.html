<p>Please note the Talk Theme <b>"Real World Go Usage"</b>.</p>
<p>Anyone with any level of Go knowledge is a candidate for a great topic at this conference. As we will get attendees of all kinds, we need speakers of all kinds. In all ways and manners, we will try to assemble the most diverse conference we can, and we do that with your help.</p>
<p>These are the traditional talk sessions given during the main conference days, Friday through Saturday. All talks are <b>20 minutes long</b>.</p>
<p>As for the topic, that's up to you. We want something for everyone. We want the hot topics in the community right now. We also want the hot topics for the future. Where is Go going? You tell us. You're the people who make those decisions and we want to share them.</p>
<p>GopherConIndia is entirely volunteer-organized and run, and works hard to keep costs as low as possible.</p>
